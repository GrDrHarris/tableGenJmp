# tablegenjmp README

This extension enables you to jump to definition when handling with LLVM tableGen.

## How to use

- click the typeName
- press the hotkey (ctrl+alt+J by default)

Modify ```tablegenjmp.includePath``` to add include directories.

Problems may occur when opening large files: I am too lazy to code for waiting the open command to finish, I just wait for 100ms and expect the opening process has completed.
